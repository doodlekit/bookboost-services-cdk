Introduction to "Alcohol is the Solution" Written and read by the author Corey Berrier

Chapter 1 The Mind's Deception Alcoholism is a cruel master, a thief that robs its victims of their will, their health, and their very sense of self. It twists the mind, warping reality into a
never-ending cycle of misery and lies. The alcoholic's mind is a battleground where the ego and the rational self Wage a relentless war, and more often than not, the ego wins, wielding its power not as a shield, but as a cage.

The alcoholic's ego is an absolute nightmare, whispering lies that sound like truths. It convinces the alcoholic that drinking is the only way to cope, the only way to feel normal. It tells stories of invincibility and control, insisting that one more drink won't hurt. That sobriety is unattainable, and that life without alcohol is a lonely, dark existence with no chance of happiness, joy, or comfort.

This false protector is, in reality, a sinister thief, tightening the chains of addiction under the illusions of defense. The ego creates a mirage of protection, but in truth it effectively builds barriers that isolate the alcoholic from the world. Fear becomes a constant companion. Fear of people. Fear of social interactions, fear of rejection, and even fear of facing the day without the numbing cocktail of alcohol.

These fears are not just fleeting anxieties. They are deep, paralyzing phobias that destroy the will to engage with life. Depression sets in a dark, unrelenting cloud that suffocates any semblance of hope. The alcoholic wakes each day to a gray dawn of despair, the weight of their reality pressing down with a force that seems impossible to bear.

Simple tasks become monumental challenges, and the mind plays terrible tricks, whispering that escape is only a drink away. But this is a lie, a cruel trick of the mind that leads only deeper into the dark night of the soul. Anxiety, too, is a relentless tormentor. It claws at the edges of every thought, turning even mundane situations into sources of panic.

The heart races, the palms sweat, and the mind spiral into catastrophic thinking. The alcoholic becomes trapped in a constant state of fight or flight, unable to find peace or serenity. Isolation becomes both a symptom and a consequence of this mental turmoil. The alcoholic retreats from the world, unable to face the shame and guilt that accompanies their addiction.

They withdraw from family, friends, and society, creating a self-imposed isolation that deepens their despair. The walls close in and the world becomes a smaller, darker place where the only friend is the relentless craving for the next drink. The mind, in its twisted state, convinces the alcoholic that they are alone in their suffering and that no one could possibly understand the depth of their pain.

This isolation is compounded by the stigma of addiction, the fear of judgment and rejection that keeps them silent and suffering alone with a paralyzed mind. The reality is that the alcoholic is caught in a vicious cycle, a cornfield maze on Halloween with no clear exit. The mind is both the

architect and the prisoner of this trap, creating and reinforcing the very conditions that perpetuate the addiction.

It is a tragic irony that the very organ that should be guiding the alcoholic toward recovery is instead leading them deeper into destruction. Breaking free from this cycle requires a monumental effort, a reprogramming of the mind, and a dismantling of the ego's ridiculous defenses. It requires confronting the fears and anxieties head-on and seeking help from those who understand and can provide the support and tools needed for recovery.

It demands a willingness to face the pain and the truth of their condition, to step out of the isolation and into the light of honesty and healing. In the end, the battle is not just against the bottle, but against the mind's own treacherous tricks. It is a fight for liberation from the chains of fear, depression, and anxiety, A struggle to reclaim one's life from the grip of addiction.

It is a journey towards a future where the mind can be an ally, not an enemy, and where true protection comes from sobriety and self-awareness, not from the lies of the ego.

Chapter 2 The Dry Drunk Sobriety for many marks the end of a tumultuous relationship with alcohol, but for some, it is only the beginning of another equally insidious struggle. The term dry drunk refers to those who have ceased drinking but continue to live with the same destructive behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that characterize their addiction.

They are sober in body but not in mind, trapped in a state of constant turmoil, their lives still dominated by the very demons they struggle to escape. A dry drunk lives in a prison constructed by their own ego. Though they no longer turn to alcohol, their mind remains captured by the same delusions and defense mechanisms.

The insidious ego whispers that they are strong for having quit, even as it keeps them shackled to old habits and toxic patterns. It convinces them that they are superior to those who still drink, inflating their pride and fostering a silent scorn for others. Pride and selfishness become defining traits of the dry drunk.

They may look down on others, seeing their sobriety as a badge of honor that sets them apart. This pride is a fragile facade, a veneer that masks the ongoing inner turmoil. Self-centeredness reigns supreme as they focus inward, consumed by their own struggles and victories, often to the exclusion of empathy and genuine connection with others.

Fear, once numbed by alcohol, now lurks in every corner of the dry drunk's mind. Fear of relapse, fear of failure, fear of facing the pain that alcohol once dulled. This fear can be paralyzing, leading to avoidance and denial. They may lie, cheat, and manipulate to maintain the illusion of control, even as their world crumbles around them.

The mind Trapped in ego, clings to these behaviors as a twisted form of protection. Lying becomes second nature, a way to hide the continuing struggle and maintain the semblance of

normalcy. Cheating, whether in relationships or in small, everyday actions, becomes a way to navigate a world that feels threatening and uncontrollable.

Silent scorn festers, directed at both themselves and others, a manifestation of the deep-seated resentment and unresolved anger that sobriety alone cannot dispel. The pain and despair of the dry drunk are no less real than those of the active alcoholic. They live in a constant state of emotional turbulence, unable to find peace or satisfaction.

The absence of alcohol does not equate to the presence of serenity. Instead, it often lays bare the raw nerves and unresolved issues that alcohol once masked. Their mind is a battlefield where the ego wages a relentless war against any semblance of vulnerability or authenticity. Worry becomes a constant companion, a background hum that never truly fades.

They worry about their sobriety, about how others perceive them, about the future and the past. This worry is both a symptom and a cause of their continued suffering, perpetuating the cycle of anxiety and fear. The mannerisms of the dry drunk mirror those of their drinking days. They may still engage in the same destructive behaviors, albeit in different forms.

The anger, bitterness, and resentment that fueled their drinking now find new outlets. They may lash out at loved ones, retreat into isolation, or immerse themselves in other addictive behaviors, all in an effort to escape the pain they cannot seem to confront. In this state, the dry drunk remains trapped, a prisoner of their own mind.

The true solution lies not merely in abstaining from alcohol, but in addressing the underlying issues that drove them to drink in the first place. It requires a deep, often painful journey of
self-discovery and healing. Therapy, support groups, and a commitment to personal growth are essential steps on this path.

To break free from the clutches of the dry, drunk state, one must confront the ego, dismantling its defenses and embracing vulnerability. It means acknowledging the pain and fear, seeking help, and fostering genuine connections with others. Only through this process can they hope to find true freedom, peace, and a life that is not merely dry.

but genuinely fulfilling. Key takeaways. A dry drunk remains trapped in destructive behaviors and emotions despite abstaining from alcohol. The ego continues to deceive and protect, fostering pride, selfishness, and fear. The pain, despair, and fear of a dry drunk are similar to those experienced during active addiction.

True recovery requires addressing underlying issues and engaging in deep personal growth and healing.

Chapter 3. The Power of Surrender. In the Throes of Addiction, the idea of surrender seems unfathomable. The very notion of relinquishing control to something unseen, unheard, and intangible feels like an admission of defeat. For someone trapped in the cycle of alcoholism or

addiction, control becomes a lifeline, a desperate attempt to manage the chaos that consumes their life.

I, too, clung to the illusion of control, believing that I alone could navigate the mess I had created. It was only when I surrendered to something bigger than myself that I found the true path to recovery. Surrendering to a higher power, whom I call God, was a concept I initially resisted with every fiber of my being.

I prided myself on my independence, my ability to solve my own problems, and my resilience in the face of adversity. I saw myself as the master of my fate, the one who could single-handedly pull myself out of any mess. But this belief was bullshit, a comforting lie that my ego clung to as my life spiraled further out of control.

The more I tried to assert my dominance over my addiction, The more entrenched I became. I placed my faith in everything but God, turning to temporary solutions and quick fixes that offered fleeting relief but no lasting peace. How was I supposed to give my life over to a mysterious, unseen power? The very idea seemed absurd.

I demanded tangible, immediate results, not abstract promises. Yet, as my efforts to control my life continued to fail, I was forced to confront a painful truth. I was not God. Despite my achievements, despite the facade of success I had built, I could not conquer my selfishness, my self-centeredness, or my addiction on my own.

My ego, once my greatest strength, had become my greatest liability, blinding me to the reality of my situation. The turning point came when I reached the end of my rope. Exhausted, defeated, and utterly broken, I faced a choice. continue down the path of destruction, or open myself to the possibility of something greater.

It was then that I made the decision to surrender, to give up the illusion of control, and to place my trust in a power greater than myself. For me, that power was God. Surrendering was not an act of weakness, but a profound act of courage. It required me to smash all ideas of control, to let go of the reins and trust in a force I could neither see nor touch.

It was a leap of faith. A step into the unknown. Yet in that surrender, I found a strength I had never known. I discovered that true power lies not in domination, but in submission, not in control, but in trust. In giving my life over to God, I began to see the world and myself in a new light. I realized that my selfishness and self-centeredness were not insurmountable obstacles, but symptoms of a deeper spiritual malady.

My ego, once a benefit, began to crumble, revealing the vulnerability and humanity beneath. I came to understand that being normal, like everyone else, was not the goal. The goal was to be the best version of myself, guided by a power greater than my own. The process of surrender was transformative. It allowed me to break free from the prison of my ego and embrace a life of humility, gratitude, and connection.

I learned to trust in God's plan even when I couldn't see the path ahead. I found serenity in the knowledge that I was not alone, that I was part of something much larger than myself. This realization brought a profound sense of peace, replacing the chaos and fear that had once ruled my life. In surrendering to God, I found the strength to overcome my addiction and reclaim my life.

I became a more compassionate, empathetic, and grounded person. I learned that true success is not measured by accolades or achievements, but by the depth of one's character and the quality of one's relationships. Through surrender, I discovered a purpose and a sense of belonging that I had never known.

Key Takeaways Surrendering to a higher power is a crucial step in overcoming addiction and reclaiming one's life. The illusion of control and the ego are significant obstacles that must be dismantled for true recovery. Trusting in a higher power, such as God, can bring profound peace, strength, and transformation.

Recovery is not about becoming normal, but about becoming the best version of oneself, guided by humility and spiritual growth.

Chapter 4 Embracing Vulnerability Admitting that I was broken and incapable of managing my own life felt like an insurmountable hurdle. It was a direct confrontation with my deepest fears and insecurities. To acknowledge my weakness, my inability to control my addiction, seemed like an admission of defeat.

What would people think? What would they say? These questions haunted me, amplifying my anxiety and pride. The fear of judgment was a powerful deterrent. I imagined whispers behind my back, looks of pity or disdain, and the stigma that comes with admitting to a problem like addiction. In my mind, I had built up a narrative where my significance was magnified, where I was the center of everyone's attention.

I believed that everyone would scrutinize my every move, my every failure. The truth, as I would come to realize, was far different. Most people are preoccupied with their own lives, their own struggles, and their own challenges. The reality is that people are often more focused on themselves than on others.

My perceived importance was a construct of my ego, a delusion that kept me from seeing the world as it truly is. In my addiction, I believed that I was different, special in my suffering. I thought my struggles were unique and that my pain set me apart from everyone else. This belief was rooted in my ego, in the self-centered perspective that addiction fosters.

I couldn't see that my experience, while deeply personal, was not unique. Many others had walked this path, faced these same demons, and found a way out. Admitting my brokenness required a profound shift in perspective. It meant letting go of the illusion of control, accepting

my vulnerability, and understanding that seeking help was not a sign of weakness but of strength.

It was a humbling process, one that stripped away the layers of pride and ego that had built up over years of denial and self-deception. In admitting my brokenness, I found a surprising liberation. The burden of pretending to have it all together was lifted, and with it, the constant pressure to maintain a facade of strength and competence.

I began to see that vulnerability is not a weakness but a powerful catalyst for growth and connection. It opens the door to genuine relationships, empathy, and understanding. The people who mattered most in my life were not the ones who judged me for my struggles, but the ones who supported me through them.

They valued my honesty, respected my courage to seek help, and and stood by me as I navigated the difficult path to recovery. By admitting my brokenness, I was able to develop deeper, more authentic connections with those around me. Recovery taught me that true strength lies in acknowledging our limitations and seeking help when we need it.

It is in our vulnerability that we find resilience, in our humility that we discover true power. By letting go of the need to appear invincible, I found a deeper sense of self. and a greater capacity for compassion and empathy. In the end, admitting that I was broken and couldn't manage my own life was the first step towards healing.

It was an act of courage that set the stage for a transformative journey. I learned that I didn't have to be perfect, that it was okay to struggle, and that seeking help was a sign of wisdom, not weakness. Key takeaways. Admitting brokenness and the inability to manage one's own life is a critical step in recovery.

Fear of judgment and the illusion of personal importance are significant barriers to seeking help. Most people are focused on their own lives and not as concerned with others as we might think. Vulnerability is a strength, that fosters genuine relationships and personal growth. True strength and resilience come from acknowledging limitations and seeking support.

Chapter five, making a list and checking it twice. One of the pivotal moments in my journey to recovery was making a comprehensive list, a daunting and humbling task that forced me to confront my past and take responsibility for my actions. This exercise, often a key step in recovery programs, involved listing all the people I was upset with, what they did, my part in the situation, and how it affected me.

It was a grueling process, but it was essential for my healing and growth. As I sat down to compile this list, I was overwhelmed by a surge of emotions. Anger, shame, guilt, and regret all hit me at once. I was angry at myself and at the people closest to me. I blamed them for their actions and for the ways they treated me, and I also blamed myself for my responses and behaviors.

The weight of my resentment and the weight of my mistakes pressed heavily on my heart. Writing this list was a painful but necessary exercise. It forced me to look at the person I had become, a person who had hurt others and myself through my addiction and selfishness. I had to acknowledge the ways in which I had failed as a friend, partner, and family member.

Each name on the list represented a relationship damaged or destroyed by my actions. One of the hardest parts of this process was admitting my own role in the situations that had caused me so much pain. It was easy to blame others for their wrongdoings, you. But much harder to see and accept my own faults.

I had to recognize that my actions, driven by addiction and selfishness, had contributed significantly to the conflicts and isolation I experienced. I realized that my deep feelings of anger and resentment towards others were often a reflection of my self-loathing. I hated the person I had become, and it was easier to project that hatred onto others than to face it within myself.

Trust had been shattered, not just in others, I had let myself down time and time again, breaking promises and betraying my own values. There were names on that list that stirred intense feelings of hatred. People I felt had wronged me in ways that seemed unforgivable. But as I examined each situation, I began to see a pattern.

Almost all of my anger stemmed from my own actions and the consequences that followed. I had to confront the fact that I was not an innocent victim, but an active participant in creating the turmoil in my life. The list was not just a catalog of grievances. It was a mirror reflecting my own flaws and failures.

It showed me the extent of the damage I had caused and the relationships I had neglected or abused. It was a harsh reminder of the person I had become, someone I did not want to be. Making this list was the first step towards making amends. It was a necessary reckoning with my past, an inventory of my wrongs, and a guide for my future actions.

By identifying the people I had hurt and the ways I had hurt them, I began to see the path to reconciliation and healing. I started to understand the importance of taking responsibility for my actions and the power of genuine amends. This process was not easy. It required brutal honesty and a willingness to face the darkest parts of myself.

But it was also liberating. By acknowledging my mistakes, I was able to start the process of forgiving myself and others. I began to see that redemption was possible, but only if I was willing to do the hard work of making things right. Key takeaways. Making a list of people hurt by your actions is a crucial step in the recovery process.

Fostering self-awareness and responsibility. This exercise reveals not only others' wrongdoings but also your own role in conflicts and isolation. Recognizing one's own faults and contributions

to problems is essential for genuine healing and reconciliation. The process is challenging but necessary for making amends and moving forward with integrity and compassion.


Chapter 6. Admitting my own insecurities and fears to another man. The next step in my recovery journey was one that I approached with trepidation and anxiety. Admitting my insecurities, fears, and mistakes to another person. This step, often part of recovery programs, required a level of honesty and vulnerability that I had never experienced before.

It meant opening up about the kind of person I had been and the wrongs I had committed to trusting someone else with that knowledge. The prospect of this step was daunting. I couldn't help but worry about how it would be received. Would this person see me as the flawed, broken individual I felt I was?

Would he be repulsed by my confessions and think about how fast he could get away from me? The fear of rejection loomed large, and the possibility that my admissions could be shared with others and become common knowledge was terrifying. These fears made it hard to take that crucial step forward. Trust was a scarce commodity in my life.

My addiction had eroded my ability to trust others and myself. The lies I had told, the betrayals I had committed, and the damage I had inflicted had left me deeply mistrustful. I had become adept at keeping my vulnerabilities hidden, wearing a mask of bravado and self-sufficiency to protect myself from judgment and hurt.

Choosing to reveal my true self, warts and all, to another man required an immense leap of faith. I had to believe that he would listen without judgment. That he would hold my confessions in confidence, and that he would not use my vulnerabilities against me. This was a tall order for someone who had so little experience with trust.

The moment arrived, and I found myself sitting across from a fellow in recovery, someone who had walked a similar path and understood the depths of my struggles. I took a deep breath and began to speak. At first, the words came haltingly, each admission feeling like an act of
self-betrayal. I spoke of my insecurities, the fears that had haunted me, and the mistakes that weighed heavily on my conscience.

As I continued, a remarkable thing happened. The more I shared, the lighter I felt. The act of verbalizing my fears and insecurities, of owning my mistakes in front of another person, began to strip them of their power. Instead of recoiling, the man listened with empathy and understanding. He didn't judge me.

He didn't turn away. Instead, he offered words of encouragement and shared his own experiences, creating a bridge of connection and mutual support. This exchange was transformative for the first time I felt truly seen and understood. The act of sharing my darkest secrets and deepest fears did not lead to the rejection I had feared.

Instead, it opened the door to a profound sense of relief and acceptance. I realized that I was not alone in my struggles. and that others had faced similar demons and found a way to overcome them. Admitting my insecurities and fears to another person was a pivotal step in rebuilding my capacity for trust.

It helped me see that vulnerability is not a weakness but a strength. It allowed me to forge genuine connections based on honesty and mutual respect. By letting go of the need to hide my true self, I began to dismantle the walls that had kept me isolated and alone. This step also reinforced the importance of accountability and recovery.

By admitting my wrongs to another person, I was taking responsibility for my actions and committing to change. It was a humbling experience, but one that laid the groundwork for genuine healing and growth. It helped me see that recovery is not a solitary journey, but one that is enriched by the support and understanding of others.

Key takeaways. Admitting insecurities and fears to another person is a crucial step in recovery. Fostering Vulnerability and Honesty. Trusting someone with personal confessions can be daunting, but is essential for healing and growth. Sharing fears and mistakes can strip them of their power and open the door to empathy and understanding.

Vulnerability is a strength that allows for genuine connections and mutual support in the recovery process. Accountability and responsibility are reinforced through this step, laying the groundwork for genuine change and growth.


Chapter 7, Removing Defects of Character. When I embarked on the journey of recovery, I naively assumed that once I reached the point of addressing my character defects, I would be instantly wiped clean of all my flaws. I believed that by admitting my wrongs and seeking to correct them, I would emerge as a new person, free from the baggage of my past.

However, reality proved to be much more complex. For most of my life, I had interpreted things through the lens of how I wanted them to be, not how they truly were. This tendency skewed my expectations and led me to believe in quick fixes and instant transformations. As I delved into the process of identifying and addressing my character defects, I quickly realized that these flaws were not going to vanish overnight.

They were deeply ingrained in my psyche, entwined with my habits and behaviors. One of the first lessons I learned was that I was ready to let go of most of my defects, but not all of them. Some provided a perverse sense of satisfaction, a feeling that I still had some control over my life. These remnants of my old self were comforting in their familiarity, even though they were destructive.

They gave me a false sense of security, a sick satisfaction that made me reluctant to part with them. Take, for instance, my habit of hiding how much money I spent on cigars. Despite our financial struggles, I would order cigars online, justifying it as the most economical way to buy them. As soon as the packages arrived, I would quickly snatch them from the porch and stash them in my trunk, much like a crackhead hiding his stash.

This behavior might sound crazy, but it was rooted in a fear of my wife finding out and having a stroke from the stress of our financial situation. The problem wasn't the cigars themselves, but the sneaky behavior that accompanied them, a relic of my addictive past. This pattern of deceit and concealment was reminiscent of the tactics I used when I was using.

For example, at meetings, I would abstain from eating cookies or donuts to present a facade of healthy living. Yet, I would stop at the store afterward and buy a dozen cookies or donuts, consuming almost all of them in secret. Once again, it was addict behavior manifesting in a different form. These actions highlighted that I was still a work in progress.

My justification for these behaviors was that I wasn't using illegal substances. However, the underlying patterns of deceit and compulsion were still very much alive. Recognizing these defects was the first step, but removing them required a much deeper level of introspection and commitment. I had to confront the fact that my character defects were deeply seeded in my mind.

They were not just habits, but aspects of my identity that had been cultivated over years of addiction. Letting go of them meant dismantling parts of myself that I had relied on for a long time. It was a painful process, fraught with setbacks and moments of doubt. The journey to remove these defects involved continuous self-examination and a willingness to change.

I had to develop new coping mechanisms, ones that did not rely on deceit or compulsion. I learned to be honest with myself and others about my struggles, no matter how small they seemed. I also had to cultivate patience, understanding that transformation is a gradual process, not an instantaneous event.

In the end, acknowledging that I was a work in progress allowed me to approach my recovery with humility and resilience. Each day was an opportunity to chip away at my defects. to become a better version of myself. It wasn't about perfection, but progress, about striving to be honest, authentic, and compassionate.

Key takeaways. The removal of character defects is a gradual process, not an instantaneous transformation. Some defects provide a false sense of control and satisfaction, making them difficult to let go. Addictive behaviors can manifest in new forms even after substance use stops. Continuous self-examination and honesty are crucial in addressing deeply ingrained flaws.

Recovery is about progress, not perfection, and involves patience and resilience in becoming a better version of oneself.

Chapter 8, Asking for Help, Felt Impossible Admitting my flaws and insecurities was a big step in my recovery, but it was only the beginning. Once I shared my struggles with Charlie, the man guiding me through this process, the real work began. I had to take action and embrace accountability, a concept I had long despised.

The idea of having someone to answer to felt suffocating, yet it was a necessary part of my journey. Charlie's role in my recovery was not to judge or control me but to guide me. He was there to offer support, wisdom, and a listening ear. Whether I smoked cigars or indulged in other old habits didn't affect his life, it affected mine.

Charlie's indifference to my actions was a stark reminder that the responsibility for my behavior and its consequences rested solely with me. This realization was both liberating and daunting. Accountability was something I had avoided for much of my life. The thought of being responsible to someone else made me uncomfortable because it meant facing my shortcomings and acknowledging my failures.

But in this new phase of my recovery, I couldn't escape it. I had to be honest with Charlie about my actions. Not because it mattered to him, but because it mattered to me. Every time I considered straying from my commitments, I thought about the promises I had made. To Charlie, and, more importantly, to myself.

I didn't want to be a liar anymore. I had spent too long deceiving others and myself. The weight of those lies had become unbearable, and I was determined to shed that burden. Keeping my promises was about more than just not wanting to let Charlie down. It was about restoring my own integrity and self-respect.

If I couldn't be truthful with myself, how could I expect to be honest with anyone else? This was a pivotal realization. The accountability I dreaded became a tool for self-improvement, pushing me to align my actions with my values. With Charlie's guidance, I began to see that Asking for help and holding myself accountable were acts of humility and strength.

They were not signs of weakness, but steps toward reclaiming my life from the grips of addiction. Each time I checked in with Charlie, each time I admitted a slip or a success, I was reinforcing my commitment to change. I also learned that accountability fostered a sense of community and support. By sharing my journey with someone else, I was no longer isolated in my struggles.

Charlie's presence reminded me that I didn't have to navigate this path alone. His support and understanding provided a foundation upon which I could build a new, healthier life. Ultimately, the person I was most accountable to was myself. Every promise kept, every truth told, and every step taken in alignment with my values strengthened my self-confidence.

I began to trust myself again and to believe in my ability to change. This self-trust was crucial. It was the cornerstone of my recovery. Humbly asking for help was a transformative experience. It taught me the value of vulnerability and the importance of being honest with myself and others. It showed me that true strength lies in admitting our weaknesses and seeking the support we need to overcome them.

Key takeaways. Admitting flaws and seeking help is the first step, but taking action and embracing accountability is essential for progress. Accountability helps maintain integrity and self-respect, fostering personal growth. Asking for help and being accountable are acts of humility and strength, not weakness.

Support and guidance from others can create a sense of community and reduce isolation. Ultimately, being accountable to oneself is crucial for rebuilding trust and achieving lasting change.


Chapter 10, The Dreaded Amends. After making a comprehensive list of those I had wronged, the next daunting step was to make amends. This was a process I approached with a mixture of fear and determination. The idea of confronting the people I had hurt, admitting my wrongs, and seeking to make things right was overwhelming.

Yet, I knew it was essential for my healing and for mending the fractured relationships in my life. Almost all of my amends went well, though the experiences varied widely. Some encounters were extremely emotional, filled with tears and heartfelt conversations. Others were surprisingly easy, marked by understanding and forgiveness.

What I learned through this process was that honesty and openness about my part in each situation were crucial. This wasn't about offering another hollow apology. It was about making genuine amends. The distinction between an apology and an amends became clear to me. An apology is something people have heard before.

often numerous times, and it can lose its impact. It's easy to say, I'm sorry, but those words alone don't necessarily carry much weight, especially when they come from someone with a history of broken promises and repeated offenses. An amends, however, goes deeper. It involves not only acknowledging the hurt caused but also committing to change through actions.

Making amends meant explaining how I intended to ensure these issues would not happen again, to the best of my ability. It was about demonstrating a genuine commitment to change and showing that I had learned from my mistakes. This approach required me to be fully accountable, to provide tangible evidence of my efforts to improve and to rebuild trust through consistent, positive actions.

One of the most emotional amends was with my wife. I had caused her so much pain through my addiction, and the hurt ran deep. Sitting down with her, I openly acknowledged the specific

ways I had wronged her. I expressed not only my regret but also my commitment to making things right. I outlined the steps I was taking to ensure that I wouldn't repeat those behaviors.

Attending therapy, participating in support groups, and actively working on my personal growth. Her tears of relief and forgiveness were a testament to the power of genuine amends. Similarly, making amends to my daughter was a heart-wrenching experience. She had suffered from my absence, my broken promises, and the instability I brought into our home.

I sat with her and explained how sorry I was for the pain I had caused. More importantly, I showed her through my actions that I was working hard to be a better father, one she could rely on and trust. Building that trust took time, but each small step forward was a victory for both of us. Some amends were more straightforward.

Friends and family who had seen my struggles and supported me despite my behavior were generally understanding and receptive. They appreciated my honesty and were willing to give me a chance to prove myself. These interactions, while less emotionally charged, were no less important. They reinforced the value of accountability and the importance of repairing relationships.

There were also amends that involved financial restitution. Admitting to and repaying debts I had incurred was a crucial part of restoring my integrity. It wasn't just about the money. It was about honoring commitments and showing respect for those I had wronged. This process helped rebuild trust and demonstrated my commitment to making things right.

Through the process of making amends, I discovered the profound healing power of honesty, accountability, and genuine effort. Each amend, no matter how difficult, was a step towards rebuilding my life and restoring the relationships. That mattered most to me. It was a testament to the transformative power of recovery and the possibility of redemption.

Key takeaways. Making amends is a crucial step in recovery involving honest acknowledgment of wrongs and a commitment to change. The distinction between an apology and an amends is significant. An amends involves demonstrating through actions that the issues will not recur.
Emotional and straightforward amends both play important roles in repairing relationships and rebuilding trust.

Financial restitution and honoring commitments are essential parts of the amends process. The process of making amends fosters healing, accountability, and the possibility of redemption and restored relationships.

Chapter 11, Prayer and Meditation Sound Like BS When I first encountered the concepts of prayer and meditation in the context of recovery, I was skeptical. They sounded like BS to me, like something out of a self-help book that promised enlightenment but delivered little more than frustration.

Meditation conjured images of sitting cross-legged on a mountaintop humming OM for hours. A scenario that felt neither practical nor appealing. Prayer seemed equally foreign, a practice reserved for the devoutly religious, not for someone like me who was struggling to find his way out of addiction.

However, as I delved deeper into my recovery journey, I learned that meditation and prayer didn't have to fit those stereotypical images. They could be personalized to suit my needs and circumstances, providing powerful tools for healing and growth. Meditation, I discovered, is not about sitting in silence for hours on end or achieving a state of perfect calm.

It is about finding moments of stillness and introspection in whatever way works best for you. For some, meditation might involve sitting quietly and focusing on their breath. For others, it might be walking in nature, practicing mindful movement, or even engaging in a creative activity that brings a sense of peace.

The key is to start small and take baby steps. I began by sitting in silence for just one minute each day. At first, it felt uncomfortable and pointless. My mind raced and I struggled to stay still. But as I persisted, I found that even one minute of quiet reflection could make a difference. It was a chance to pause, breathe, and reset.

Over time, I gradually increased the duration, experimenting with different techniques until I found what worked for me. The worst-case scenario, I told myself, was that I would try meditation and decide it wasn't for me. The best-case scenario was that I might find some inner peace and clarity. It was worth the effort, even if it felt awkward or challenging at first.

And indeed, I began to notice subtle changes. Meditation helped me develop a greater awareness of my thoughts and emotions, and I was able to allow me to respond to them more calmly and thoughtfully. Prayer, on the other hand, became an essential part of my daily routine. At first, it felt strange and uncomfortable, like talking to an invisible entity.

But as I practiced, I realized that prayer was a humble way to ask for help and seek guidance. It was an acknowledgment that my way hadn't worked in the past and that I needed a higher power's assistance to find a new path. For me, prayer is as vital as oxygen. It is a lifeline that connects me to something greater than myself.

providing comfort and direction. Personally, I pray on my knees because it humbles me. This physical act of bowing down serves as a reminder of my need for humility and grace. It is a way of surrendering my ego and opening myself to the possibility of change and growth. Through prayer, I ask for the strength to stay on the path of recovery, for the wisdom to make better choices, and for the courage to face my challenges head-on.

It is a practice that grounds me and keeps me focused on my goals. Prayer is not about reciting specific words or following a rigid formula. It is about speaking from the heart and being honest about my needs and desires. Both prayer and meditation have become cornerstones of my

recovery. They provide balance and perspective, helping me navigate the ups and downs of life with greater resilience.

While I was initially skeptical, I have come to see their value and importance. They are not magic cures or instant solutions. But they are powerful practices that support my ongoing journey of healing and self-discovery. Key Takeaways Meditation and prayer, while often misunderstood, can be powerful tools for recovery and personal growth.

Meditation does not require extended periods of silence or specific postures. It can be personalized to fit individual needs and preferences. Starting with small steps, like sitting in silence for one minute, can help build a meditation practice.

Both practices provide balance, perspective, and resilience, supporting the ongoing journey of recovery and self discovery.

Chapter 12 Get Over Yourself and Your Selfishness The final piece of my recovery puzzle came when I learned to get over myself and my inherent selfishness. It wasn't an easy lesson, but it was the most transformative. The fear of other people and my personal hang-ups had kept me isolated and stuck for so long.

Chapter 13 Life on Life's Terms Navigating sobriety is a journey filled with highs and lows. When I first got sober, I naively believed that everything would instantly become perfect. But life has a way of challenging us, no matter our state of sobriety. It quickly became clear that sobriety didn't equate to a trouble free existence.

Instead, I had to learn to live life on life's terms. This meant facing tough times head on without the crutch of alcohol. The truth is, it's never been about the drink. Alcohol was never the real

problem. It was a symptom of deeper issues. The real challenge was learning to become a genuinely caring and empathetic person.

It meant taking myself out of my self centered mindset long enough to help someone else. This is a hard concept to grasp, but it's one that transforms lives. In my experience, whenever I stopped thinking about myself and focused on helping others, my life expanded in unimaginable ways. When I recommitted to my recovery and found someone to guide me, everything began to change.

I started doing whatever it took to stay sober and truly engaged in the recovery process. The results were astounding. I recently published my first book on Audible, and my podcast, The Successful Life Podcast, hit one million downloads. These milestones are not about bragging. They're about what's possible.

I was a guy who couldn't stay sober, who thought he was invincible, maybe even God. If that sounds like you, let me tell you this. You're not God.

Chapter 9, The List. As I continued my journey through recovery, I reached a pivotal step that required an even deeper level of introspection and honesty. Making a list. This wasn't just any list, it was a comprehensive inventory of all the people I had wronged, the people I owed money to, and those I had hurt.

This task forced me to confront the full scope of my actions and their impact on the lives of those around me. This list-making exercise was directly connected to where I acknowledged

my anger and selfishness. Many of the people who appeared on that initial list of grievances were now reappearing here, but this time from a different perspective.

It wasn't about what they had done to me, it was about what I had done to them. It was a humbling process, one that required me to take full responsibility for my actions and their consequences. As I began compiling the list, I found myself facing a daunting array of names. My wife and daughter were at the top as my addiction had deeply impacted my relationship with them.

I had hurt them in ways that were painful to admit. My selfishness and self-centered behavior had caused them emotional pain and strained our bond. They had endured my erratic behavior, my broken promises, and the instability I brought into our home. Friends and family members also made the list. These were people who had tried to support me, who had extended their hands in friendship.

Only to be met with my deceit, manipulation, and neglect. I had taken their trust for granted and often repaid their kindness with betrayal. Each name on the list was a reminder of a broken promise, a missed opportunity, or a relationship affected by my actions. Employers and colleagues were not spared. My addiction had spilled over into my professional life, affecting my performance and reliability.

I had let down people who depended on me, missed deadlines, and created a reputation for being untrustworthy and unpredictable. The financial and reputational damage I had caused was significant, and now I had to face it. Owing money to people added another layer of complexity. Financial irresponsibility was a hallmark of my addiction.

I had borrowed money, often with little intention or ability to repay it. These debts were a tangible manifestation of my disregard for others' generosity and my failure to manage my life responsibly. Each entry on the list was more than just a name, it was a story of pain and betrayal, a chapter of my life that I had to acknowledge and take responsibility for.

This process was incredibly painful, as it brought to light the full extent of the damage I had caused. It was also profoundly necessary as it laid the groundwork for making amends and rebuilding trust. Writing this list was not just an exercise in documentation, it was an act of contrition. It forced me to see myself through the eyes of those I had hurt, to understand the pain I had inflicted, and to recognize the need for genuine repentance.

It was a crucial step in my journey towards healing, not only for myself but for those I had wronged. The list was a roadmap for the next phase of my recovery. It provided a clear outline of the relationships that needed mending and the debts that needed repaying. It was a tangible representation of the work that lay ahead, the amends I needed to make, and the trust I needed to rebuild.

By acknowledging these wrongs, I began to dismantle the walls of denial and deflection that had kept me from seeing the true impact of my actions. I realized that recovery wasn't just about quitting substances. It was about becoming a better person, someone who took responsibility for their actions and sought to make things right.

Key takeaways. Making a list of people wronged, those owed money, and those hurt is a crucial step in recovery, fostering accountability, and self-awareness. This list highlights the full extent of the damage caused by addiction, affecting relationships with family, friends, employers, and others. Writing the list is an act of contrition, forcing acknowledgment of the pain inflicted, and laying the groundwork for making amends.

Recovery involves not just quitting substances, but becoming a person who takes responsibility for their actions and seeks to rebuild trust and repair relationships. The list serves as a roadmap for the next phase of recovery, guiding efforts to make amends and restore damaged relationships.


Chapter 10, The Dreaded Amends. After making a comprehensive list of those I had wronged, the next daunting step was to make amends. This was a process I approached with a mixture of fear and determination. The idea of confronting the people I had hurt, admitting my wrongs, and seeking to make things right was overwhelming.

Yet, I knew it was essential for my healing and for mending the fractured relationships in my life. Almost all of my amends went well, though the experiences varied widely. Some encounters were extremely emotional, filled with tears and heartfelt conversations. Others were surprisingly easy, marked by understanding and forgiveness.

What I learned through this process was that honesty and openness about my part in each situation were crucial. This wasn't about offering another hollow apology. It was about making genuine amends. The distinction between an apology and an amends became clear to me. An apology is something people have heard before.

often numerous times, and it can lose its impact. It's easy to say, I'm sorry, but those words alone don't necessarily carry much weight, especially when they come from someone with a history of broken promises and repeated offenses. An amends, however, goes deeper. It involves not only acknowledging the hurt caused, but also committing to change through actions.

Making amends meant explaining how I intended to ensure these issues would not happen again, to the best of my ability. It was about demonstrating a genuine commitment to change and showing that I had learned from my mistakes. This approach required me to be fully accountable, to provide tangible evidence of my efforts to improve, and to rebuild trust through consistent, positive actions.

One of the most emotional amends was with my wife. I had caused her so much pain through my addiction, and the hurt ran deep. Sitting down with her, I openly acknowledged the specific ways I had wronged her. I expressed not only my regret, but also my commitment to making things right. I outlined the steps I was taking to ensure that I wouldn't repeat those behaviors.

Attending therapy, participating in support groups, and actively working on my personal growth. Her tears of relief and forgiveness were a testament to the power of genuine amends. Similarly, making amends to my daughter was a heart wrenching experience. She had suffered from my absence, my broken promises, and the instability I brought into our home.

I sat with her and explained how sorry I was for the pain I had caused. More importantly, I showed her through my actions that I was working hard to be a better father, one she could rely on and trust. Building that trust took time, but each small step forward was a victory for both of us. Some amends were more straightforward.

Friends and family who had seen my struggles and supported me despite my behavior were generally understanding and receptive. They appreciated my honesty and were willing to give me a chance to prove myself. These interactions, while less emotionally charged, were no less important. They reinforced the value of accountability and the importance of repairing relationships.

There were also amends that involved financial restitution. Admitting to and repaying debts I had incurred was a crucial part of restoring my integrity. It wasn't just about the money. It was about honoring commitments and showing respect for those I had wronged. This process helped rebuild trust and demonstrated my commitment to making things right.

Through the process of making amends, I discovered the profound healing power of honesty, accountability, and genuine effort. Each amend, no matter how difficult, was a step towards rebuilding my life and restoring the relationships. That mattered most to me. It was a testament to the transformative power of recovery and the possibility of redemption.

Key takeaways. Making amends is a crucial step in recovery involving honest acknowledgement of wrongs and a commitment to change. The distinction between an apology and an amends is significant. An amends involves demonstrating through actions that the issues will not recur.
Emotional and straightforward amends both play important roles in repairing relationships and rebuilding trust.

Financial restitution and honoring commitments are essential parts of the amends process. The process of making amends fosters healing, accountability, and the possibility of redemption and restored relationships.
