Running a great selection process requires the right mindset and proper
preparation. The enemy of great is the rushed process, �I just needed someone
yesterday!�

I�d like you to imagine that you were getting ready to invest a half-million
dollars of your company�s money or better yet think of investing your money.
How carefully would you consider the investment? In most cases more money,
expense, and revenue hinge on making a good hiring decision for a sales
position than just a half-million. Treat it with the importance it deserves. Here are
the critical steps in the process of hiring a sales super-star:



Take the time to identify on a highly granular basis what skills are required
to be successful. Describe these skills clearly in the job advertisement rather
than just describing the industry or product they�ll be asked to sell.


What type of prospecting will they do?
What type of record keeping will they use?
What support structure will they have?
Is it a complex sell?

Will they be selling once to an individual?
Is it a multi-call sales process?
Will they be presenting to larger groups?
Is it an RFP process?
Are you the highest priced solution?
Are you the lowest cost solution?
How intense is the competition?
Where do you rank in size and quality to your competition?

Are they expected to find new clients and pass then on to customer care?
Will they sell and service the client?

You should be asking and answering all of these types of questions as
you create the job posting. Your goal is for the sales person to see past
successes in light of how they match up to your requirements and self-select out
of the process if they don�t think they have what it takes.

The job posting should include a realistic earning figure and expectation.
When I say �expectation,� I don�t mean they could expect to earn this much. I
mean, you expect them to earn that much or they�ll not be working for your


company. There is a big difference in the way you convey that number. A super-
star doesn�t want or need blue-sky numbers. They want real earning
expectations.

You might word this portion dealing with compensation this way: �A
successful candidate will have a history of making $90,000 per year of which
30% should have been variable compensation and a need to make $125,000.�

Once you�ve decided they might be the right person to hire, you should
always verify their earnings claim by asking for their past W-2 IRS form or
whatever form is available in your country that will help verify income. They�ve
done what they claimed they have or they haven�t. When do you want to find
out? After you�ve hired them or before? Try this to encourage honesty, �If we
decide that you would be a fit for our sales position and you decide you�d like to
accept the role, we�ll be asking you to verify your past earnings through your W-
2.� My experience has suggested that this quickly gets more honest answers
right from the start!

Describe your industry, but don�t limit the industries that you�ll accept. You
might say: �Experience selling to (your industry segment) helpful but not
required.� It is more important that the daily selling activities that you will require
of them have been a part of their recent experience and success than specific
industry experience. Obviously if you can get both, that�s ideal. But never give
industry preference over activity successes. As an example, one of my clients in


the food processing industry needed someone who could cold-call new prospects
consistently. They could have limited themselves to sales people that had
previous experience in the food processing industry. Instead, they focused on
the need to make cold-calls. They ended up hiring someone with no industry
experience, but that made cold-calls every day in the recruiting industry. That
hire ended up outperforming any previous sales hire.

Remember always to hire primarily for previous relevant types of sales
activity and not primarily industry experience. Don�t limit the candidates that will
apply by arbitrarily adding qualifications that aren�t an absolute necessity. For
instance, many companies will state that they require a college degree. Ask
yourself, �If this person is a super-star and can sell in our environment to our
clients, do I care if they have the degree?� If the answer is, �No, I don�t� then
don�t include it in the posting. Some of the best business people and sales
people haven�t been to college. That is why many times they are in sales and
out earning the college grad with the MBA. They knew if they wanted to earn a
healthy paycheck, they had better learn to sell.

Finally, you will also want to include in the job posting a request such as,
�Please provide in your cover-letter an example of a recent selling success
you�ve had that demonstrates your suitability for the role.� This request serves
two purposes. One, in the age of online applications, you will get hundreds of
applicants who are mass applying for anything with the term sales in the job title.
By adding this tiny request, you will know they�ve read your posting. Second, it


gives you an insight into how they approach sales and how they communicate.
Here is a recent job posting created for a client (edited to protect company
name):

Sample Company is seeking to add two sales people to their team.
One will be based in the Mid-Atlantic and another in a South East territory.
Ideally the successful candidates will be in place prior to the start of 2016.
Our hiring process is thorough, but moves quickly for the right candidate.

Mid-Atlantic: VA, WV, KY, NC, SC, TN
Southeast: GA, FL, AL, MS, TN,

About You

You are an accomplished salesperson with the ability to work from
a home office located within your assigned territory and travel to visit
customers and prospects 60-70% of the month. You have an ability to
prospect consistently on the phone, in person and at company trade
events. Knowledge of the packaging industry primarily in food, meats,
medical and bakery markets is preferred, but not required if you have a
history of sales success in a complex selling environment, the ability to
learn quickly and can retain knowledge. You are adept at selling solutions
that exceed $200,000 to upwards of $1MM. You are well spoken, can
command a room�s attention, and have high energy levels. People
consider you a leader and you consider a sales territory as your personal


business. You are accustomed to tracking your sales behavior and metrics
as a source of effectiveness and improvement. While already operating at
a high-level, you understand and accept training and coaching as a source
of constant growth.

You must have a verifiable history of earning in excess of $90,000,
and a need to quickly surpass $150,000. Our top earners in the field
regularly surpass $200,000 in yearly earnings excluding company
benefits. Salespeople that fail to earn at a high level are not kept at
Sample Company as our reputation, line of equipment and sales leads
provide ample opportunity for selling.

Please include in your application a cover letter with the answer to
this question: What do you consider the key to sales success and what is
one of your greatest selling successes to date? Applications without this
in the cover letter will not be considered. Feel like this job is perfect for you
but you don�t fit one of the criteria? Sell us on why you should be hired
anyway.

Did you notice the focus on the type of person rather than specifics of the
company position? This type of ad stands out amongst the clutter on hiring
websites and it serves as a magnet for top performers. Here is an actual portion
of a cover letter submitted by an applicant in response to the posting above:

�Just reading the way the job roles were �pitched� has created a
high level of interest in Sample Company. I have a solid history of selling
systems and consumables to national and international customers. Having
studied the company Website also, I am convinced it would be worthwhile
to meet the hiring managers to communicate how my abilities and sales
skill set would benefit Sample Company. I like that the job pitch was not a
long job description, but rather lays down a challenge to prospective sales
employees that success is rewarded, but failure is not supported. I really
like the way this was described, having confidence to exceed goals within


a direct and pragmatic company culture. One example of selling success I
can give is...�

Now that you have a solid job posting, go post the job. I won�t cover the
many job sites available, as it�d be out of date as soon as I wrote it and
effectiveness varies by industry and geography. Your network should be able to
recommend some solid places to post. Don�t neglect the trade journals and
websites of your industry along with the same sites for parallel industries;
meaning industries that have a very similar selling process (not the product) as
you have in your company.

In addition to posting the job, you should email the posting to as many
people in your network as possible with a brief note asking them if they know
anyone that fits what you have described. A word of caution is in order here. If
someone in your network recommends a salesperson to you, it is very easy to
allow how you feel about the person making the referral influence how you rate
the candidate. Sometimes I see companies short cut their hiring process when
dealing with someone referred to them. They almost always regret it. No matter
the source of the candidate, always follow your process. Remember that your
network has likely referred the person because they like the person or want to be
of help to you. They usually haven�t made the suggestion because they have
any knowledge of how well the person will do in your company selling your
product to your customers.


Now that you�ve posted the job, you should also pro-actively reach out to
targeted people at other companies whom you may want to consider for the
position. Remember that the very best salespeople aren�t usually in the market,
so you�ll have to lure them to take a look at your opportunity. If you want to
increase your odds of successfully luring someone, you can go back and read
the list of reasons why a super-star might be changing jobs and target those
companies. For instance, has there been a recent merger in your industry? If
so, it�s likely that at least a few top-performers are unhappy with the changes at
the new company and might be open to a job change. The trade journals are a
good source for this type of target.

Spend some time on LinkedIn reaching out to potential targets. If you pay
for the recruiter version or any of the premium memberships, you�ll have
advanced search features that can help you identify potential sales people. In
fact, you can even search by past companies that they�ve worked for if you know
a company's reputation for producing great sales people. Be creative and find
people to place in your process. Tip: LinkedIn limits your view of people to three
degrees, so it�s very helpful to expand your searchable network by joining groups
or paying for the recruiter�s version.

An important note here is that you will want to keep the process moving.

Don�t wait until all the candidates have applied before you do the next step.
Think of the entire process as a river that is constantly flowing bringing you
candidates. When I say, �next do this� it simply means do this next with the pool


of candidates that are at a particular stage in the process. Superstar candidates
never stay on the market for long.

Eventually, you will want to work on creating such a strong brand for your
company that the best candidates seek you out. This likely isn�t the position you
are in when you take over as the Sales Boss, but it is something you should take
ownership of now that you are in charge of the team. All great programmers at
least consider an interview request from Apple or Google and you want to
become the company that great salespeople take the call from when they get the
call. Some simple steps in this regard can be including some great videos about
your company on your hiring website as well as focusing on the feel and tone of
your social media presence online. Now for the next step:



Now that you have a list of applicants and a stack of resumes, you will
need to decide which ones to connect with. This is mind-numbingly dull work! I
don�t care if you are using an electronic system (ATS- Applicant Tracking
System) or if you just have paper stacks of resumes; this is an ugly process.
Buckle down and get it done. Move quickly as the best candidates will not be
available for long. You don�t have the luxury of taking a long time in the process.
If you do, you�ll lose the best and be stuck with mediocre.

I suggest the three-pile method:


1.Not a chance
2.Maybe
3.Worth a look


If you followed my earlier advice and asked that the candidate writes a
custom response to a question. You can start by placing the non-compliant ones
in stacks number two or even one if you have enough candidates.

Don�t get fooled (sold), by fancy visuals and creative writing. Remember
that many resumes are solid works of fiction and most of them have been
embellished creatively. Sometimes the worst looking resume is the super-star as
it has been a long time since they�ve applied for a new job. It never occurs to the
super-star that they�ll be judged by anything other than their proven performance.
The best looking resume is often the result of someone with lots of job-seeking
experience. I�m guessing that is not exactly the kind of experience you were
looking for when you started the search. Primarily you should be looking for
evidence that they�ve had success in the same type of selling environment that
exists at your company. Think back to the list of questions in the section of this
report on creating the job posting. How many do they match? The higher, the
better!

Make certain that they clearly articulate that they are looking for a sales
job, not a sales management job or a marketing-slash-sales job. Don�t hire the


long-term sales manager that wants back into sales. You want to hire the sales
person that has been out demonstrating they have the selling skills that you will
consistently need them to do.

What about the length of employment at previous jobs? In today's
environment, the reality is people change jobs more frequently than in the past.
What you should do is count the number of years at each role and write it in the
margins. My guess is you�ll see a pattern. The person switches jobs every three
years, etc. This should not automatically disqualify them, but you should
understand that if they work for you, you would have them for a similar length of
time. Will the time and energy and the length of your sales process make this
person worthwhile to consider? With all else being equal, your best salespeople
don�t change frequently.

One pattern you will see with some great salespeople is one lengthy
period of employment followed by 2-3 quick job changes. I�m not bothered by
this pattern as it sometimes means they did very well selling at a company;
something changed and they�ve been actively looking. They�ve taken a few roles
only to discover quickly that the job wasn�t what they thought it�d be. You�ll
discover the facts during your interview process. One pattern that disturbs me
based on my experiences is if someone has been in a selling role then tried to
start their own business and failed so now they are returning to the perceived
safety of a sales job.


As you read the resumes, underline any phrases that articulate some
result, such as: �Increased sales by x%� or �Was the number two producer�. You
will use these statements later in the interview process. How many resumes
made it to pile #3?

Let�s discuss the interviews. Every company will have a slightly different
process, so I will simply outline an effective process for most companies. If you
chose to do something different, make sure you understand why the stage was
included in my process and the impact of any change you decide to make. For
instance, I suggest a phone screen. Some will decide they only have a handful of
qualified candidates with the correct set of skills outside of the selling skills
needed (for instance maybe they need to be a doctor, engineer, or have some
very specialized knowledge) so they�ll choose to skip this step. This might make
sense.



This is an area people get wrong. They get it wrong because most of us
have a healthy desire to be liked by other people. What happens is that they
enter into the process of interviewing and they play the role of �nice guy/gal�.
They want the candidate to want to work for the company, so they spend a lot of
time making the candidate feel welcomed.


I�m going to suggest that you adopt a new mindset. Your role is to make
sure that no sales imposter makes it onto your team. Visualize someone in your
company that you like and admire. Then imagine that you�ll have to lay them off
if you let the wrong person join the sales team. What is the emotion you feel as
you tell them you can no longer afford to pay them? Capture that feeling and
bring it to the interview. The reality isn�t that far off. If your sales team is filled
with bad sales people, eventually the company closes its doors. This is critical.
You must get it right, and your co-workers are counting on you. Also, if you
become known as the sales manager that has a revolving door of new hires that
don�t work out, I can guarantee that one-day soon your manager will be showing
you the exit. Almost nothing else hurts your credibility as a manager as much as
a poor hire.

Your focus will be on being polite, but direct. Your role is not to make the
candidate comfortable. In fact, the best sales interview keeps the candidate
slightly off balance. After all, you�ll want to see how they perform under stress
since they�ll likely be calling on prospects that aren�t always eager to see them
and have their guard up. To be successful in selling, they�ll have needed to
master the skill of bonding and building rapport. Let them do the work on the
interview. You focus on getting the truth.

I�ll outline a four-stage interview process. I�ll label them here and then
delve into the specific goals of each.


1.10-minute phone screen

2.	Pressure Interview

3.	Performance Interview

4.	Romance Interview




The goal of the phone screen is simple. Do you want to use any time
visiting with the person in the next interview? Let�s be honest, sometimes you
can tell right away that they won�t fit. I�d prefer to discover that on a phone call
rather than in my office. End the call as soon as you know they aren�t a fit. Follow
a tight script. Again you should be polite, but not work overly hard to make them
comfortable. That�s their job.

Here is a script that has been used effectively for thousands of screening
calls:


�Hi, (candidate's name) this is (your name & company) calling for your
scheduled interview. We were scheduled for a quick 10 minutes does this time
still work? 	 Great! We�ve had a lot of responses to our posting, so I
apologize for working quickly today. My goal is to identify the top 3 people to
hold a lengthier in person interview with our team. We only have one spot open
and want to make sure we get the best person for the role. Fair?�


What do you know about (Company Name)?


Regardless of response simply say, �OK� and move on.


What in your experience qualifies you for this role as written?


How would you describe yourself as a sales person?


Describe your current sales job.


How do you organize your week?


Regardless of the answer simply say in a questioning tone, �And that
works?� This may make them uncomfortable or defensive. Pay attention to the
response, as it�s how they likely will act with your prospects. Are they confident?
Do they use humor? Do they try to put you at ease? Or are they simply
defensive?

I�d like you to complete my sentence. Most sales people fail because

?


I have a question about your cover letter. (Ask an appropriate question. This
simply let�s them know this is a personal interview, not a mass interview.)


Do you currently prospect for new business? If so, how?


If they say by phone: �Great! Let�s role-play that for a minute. I�m the
prospect, and I just picked up the phone and said hello�go!�

If they say by networking, adjust the above role-play. The key is to hear
them verbalize what they have been saying in their last sales role. You should
immediately detect if they are comfortable and proficient. You can certainly
discover if they haven�t prospected in ages! Someone that has done this will
have it down and it will roll off their tongue easily. Play the nice prospect. You
aren�t trying to trick them here. If they fumble somewhat here, just say, �It�s fine.
Would you like to start over?� You are simply trying to see how at ease they are
at something they should have done hundreds of times in their selling career.

Don�t give an impression of how you think they did. Simply state: �How do
you think that was? Was that a fair reflection of you?�

Describe your best sale from initial contact to close.


Pay attention to how �real� it sounds. Were they involved and leading the
sales or just around when it happened? You�ll hear the difference! Once they
finish their account, ask: �Why did you pick that example? Their answer here will
reveal much about how they view selling.


End the call. �That�s all the time we have. We�ll be contacting the top 3
candidates to schedule in-person interviews. What�s the best email to use to
schedule that?�

----- End of call----


It is important that you rate the responses to each question on a 1-3 scale
with three being the best response. Go with your gut on this and don�t overthink
it. Rate them as they answer. It won't be as effective if you wait until the end of
the call to complete your ratings.

Give them an additional 3 bonus points if you found yourself �liking them�
at the end of the call. This means, did they succeed in putting you at ease? Did
you enjoy the call? Did you start forgetting it was an interview? If so, it�s also
likely they�ll be good at the developing rapport with your company�s prospects.

Give them one additional point for each of the following:


Did they have good tone and pacing?
Were they articulate?
Did they try and ask you questions during the call and especially when you
tried to end the call? A great candidate will try and keep you on the call to
learn more specifics about the opportunity.


Tally up the total points and schedule the best for the next interview.

Remember to move fast as the best candidates won�t be on the market for long.
Can you get them in tomorrow? What about if you use a video call to do the next
interview could you get it completed sooner? Make it happen as soon as
possible.

The best email invites help frame some of the expectations for
performance. Remember that the salesperson is also judging you. Here is a
sample that you could edit and utilize:

---Begin email template ---
(Name),
Thank you for the time spent on the phone today. We would love to have
the opportunity to spend more time getting to know you and understanding if you
would be a fit for our sales team. We pride ourselves on building a great
company with happy, successful people.

We have the following dates/times available: (List options or use a
scheduling link so they can schedule right on your calendar)

You can learn more about us here: (website, social accounts, etc.)


To re-iterate, we are seeking to hire one candidate to add to our sales
team. A successful candidate will be someone with a proven record of sales


success and yet is still willing to work hard perfecting his or her skills. A new hire
will be expected to travel every-other week visiting prospects and customers in
their defined territory. Our new candidates are expected to earn a minimum of
(insert figure) including their base salary and commissions and failure to achieve
this number consistently will result in termination. We maintain this policy
because we know sales people need realistic earning figures when considering
employment and we know what is achievable in our territories due to our metrics.

If you decide to accept an interview, please bring with you to the interview
any sales collateral that you use in your current position when visiting a prospect
(brochures, power-point, etc.).

The remaining steps in our process are this interview as well as a final
interview. We expect this process to be completed quickly by (date).

Let me know what works for you. We look forward to seeing you.


--- End of email template---


Notice some key points in the email: We expect success and continuous
learning. We know our sales process and the results we can expect from a new
sales hire. We give an earning expectation and clearly state that this job is based
on performance. We also outline the remaining stages in the process and give
them a date for finishing the process. This is important, as great candidates will


be actively talking to a number of companies. If they have an interest in yours,
you�ll want them to hang in there for the process.



This interview will typically last 45 minutes. I call this the pressure
interview because once again, I want you to understand that your role is not to
make them comfortable. That�s their job. Your job is to be a guardian of the
company. If possible, it is best to have two or three people from your company
observe this interview. Note that I said to observe. I would have them take
notes, but not actively participate in the interview. Here is the format:

Don�t start with small talk. Be polite and direct. A great sales person will
have a desire to �work the room� and will establish the rapport or warmth of the
session. Let them do the work so you can see how effective they are at it.
They�ll likely do the same with your prospects. I will give you a few key building
blocks to use for this interview. You will want to add your own questions that you
find important. I give you this script simply as a guide to plan your own interview
from. This interview is sometimes done over video.

---Start of Interview Script ---


�	Thanks for coming in so quickly. As indicated on the phone screen we�ve
had a bunch of interest in this role and we wanted to visit with some of the top


candidates. I apologize in advance for moving quickly, but we�ve only got 45
minutes and there are so many things I�d like to learn.

After this interview, we�ll be asking you to verify your past references,
earnings, and we�ll quickly schedule a more traditional interview where you can
ask all sorts of questions you might have and tour the building. I know you have
a lot you want to know about us and we�ll give you that opportunity to learn more
at that time. Fair?

O.K, before we get started��Tell me what is the one thing I should
absolutely know about you if you are a part of my sales team, the one thing you
want to make sure I don�t leave this interview without understanding about you.�

�Why did you pick that one?�


�Tell me about your current/ most recent sales role.�


�How do you prospect?� Get details. How many, how often, what
conversion rate, etc. Write down the answers. Be exact. Don�t let them say 10-
20 calls. How many is it? A great sales person knows their numbers.

What are the stages of their process currently? Have them give you
conversion numbers for each stage. You may have to guide them through this
process to get numbers.


For example:

50 calls give me ten appointments.

Ten appointments get me three next steps.

Three next steps get me two quotable projects and I close 50%.


�What�s the length of your selling cycle?
How much is the size of the average sale?
Who is your competition?
How do you compare on price, quality, etc. with your competition?

What�s something you wish you�d have known when you started selling them?
What�s the biggest selling mistake you�ve made? What did it teach you?
How is your compensation structured?
How much did you sell last year?�

Now that you have numbers, work backwards with them as you calculate
the �truthfulness� of their statements. Example:

�So you sold $XXX,XXX? Based on the average size of your deals that
means you sold X clients, correct? So that�s X deals per month? So you went on
X calls, and X prospecting appointments�.�

Usually you will find the numbers they claim regarding close rate and
prospecting activities don�t line up. Just say, �I�m puzzled why these aren�t


adding up? What am I missing?� A super-star sales person won�t be ruffled or
fazed by this line. They�ll just jump in and explain things. They might even with
some humor say, �To be honest I don�t track my numbers that closely I just get
results.� A poser, a fake sales person will panic. You will see the difference
clearly!

Walk me through the best sale you�ve done for them where you were in
control from the very beginning of the sales process. You don�t want one that
was in the pipeline when they took the role. Ask lot�s of details and you�ll
discover how �real the deal� is and how much they had a role in it. A salesperson
can remember all the little facts about every deal they did. Don�t let them use
wishy-washy numbers. Be exact.

�What do I need to know about your prospects?�


OK, so I asked you to bring your sales material. Let�s role-play a typical
sales visit you make. Who should I be? Role-play as best as you can. Don�t be
tricky. Just like the phone screen, play a good prospect. The goal is to see what
their demeanor is. You want to see if they use good questioning skills, tell stories
to illustrate their points, speak concisely displaying the skills of a Sales Star.

�If you could go back and re-do that role-play, what would you change?


If you need to test the candidates responsiveness to coaching, you might
point out something that you didn�t like about the role-play and ask them to try
again.

How do you like to be managed?

How do you organize and track your process?

What�s something a past manager told you about your performance that you
disagreed with at the time?
What has been your most effective way of learning new selling skills?�


Ask a series of questions that relate to understanding their fit and
experience against the criteria you placed in the posting. For instance, if your
company sells to committees and does group presentations. Have they done
that recently and frequently?

Probe regarding any job changes.


Get the specifics regarding any claims of success you underlined
previously in their resume.

Conduct this pressure exercise:


Ask the candidate to write down (preferably on a whiteboard in the front of
the room) the top five qualities or habits they believe are critical to sales success.


Don�t comment on any of them yourself, just observe. Next ask them to rank
them in order of importance 1-5. Finally, when they are finished pick whatever is
number 4 and say, �I�m surprised (#4) wasn�t in your top 2. Why is that?� Again,
the idea is simply to see how well they articulate their position and handle stress.
There is no right or wrong answer here, but would the way they just responded
be effective if they were selling to your prospects?

---End the Interview ---


Once the candidate has left, ask each of the observers to sit quietly for the
next ten minutes and write down a summary of everything they observed or felt
about the candidate. It is important to do this without sharing your own opinion.
People will tend to adjust their own views to match the other person. Once
everyone has written their observations, have them share them with the group.
Decide if you would like the process to continue with this candidate or not. Make
the decision before leaving the room. If you�ve decided to move forward, contact
the candidate the same day.

The next two steps: The performance interview and the romance interview
can often be combined into one event. The romance interview being dependent
on how well the performance interview goes.

The performance interview


The performance interview is the chance to see how the candidate will do
in your company selling your product or service. You will provide the script,
collateral and framework for one stage in your selling process to the candidate.
Typically I like for this to be a face-to-face part of the selling process. You will
give the candidate a day or so to prepare and then ask that they role-play the
meeting with your team.

Here�s how to ask for their participation:


�(name), we�ve really been impressed with what we�ve seen so far. Just
so we can be really certain this is a product/service that you�ll enjoy selling and
so we can get a feel for how you�d present things, I�d like to ask you to do one
final thing before we make you an offer. I�ll provide the tools, scripts, and role-
play setting. I�d like you to come in and sell to our team. I realize it won�t be
perfect and you won�t have all the right answers, but we�re ok if you make up a
few things. We�d just like to see you in action. If that goes well, while you are
here I�ll give you a tour of the office, let you meet some of the rest of the team
and answer any questions you may have. When would you like to schedule
this?�

During the few days they take to prep, I continue with a few other key
processes to keep things moving along. For instance now is the time to do the
reference checks. You can ask them to arrange the calls:


�While you�re prepping for this final meeting, I�d like to have the opportunity to
speak with (list of names from former companies)�could you email them and
ask them to connect with me? Thanks!�

The reason I ask that they arrange the calls is that sometimes it saves me
from even calling the reference as the salesperson says, �well actually they might
not be the best person�� When this happens you know you haven�t received the
full truth during the interview. In the cases where they say,�sure, no problem!� I
know what they told me was likely close to a version of the truth.

You will also conduct background screening if required at your company.
This would also be a time to spend 20 minutes on Google. Google their name.
Look carefully at their LinkedIn profile. Does everything add up with what you�ve
been sold or rather told so far? I even consider looking at their home address
using Google Maps.

Read everything you can that they�ve written online.


Some might find this extreme�but hey, if I�m investing over a half-million
dollars, I�ll look for any clues I can to inform my decision.

On the day of the presentation: if possible, bring in a new set of
employees to participate in this role-play. You might even consider bringing in
other members of the sales team to participate as buyers.


Once the presentation is complete, give some feedback to the candidate.
Make sure and mention what they did well, but also point out one area that you
know they�ll need some work on. This is an important step in determining how
they react to feedback. Are they open to growth?

Move directly to the next stage if appropriate. If everyone is on the same
page regarding the candidate you can do this the same day. Remember that in
hiring a sales superstar time is of the essence.

The romance interview


This is finally the time when you get to try and woo the candidate into
falling in love with your company. Pull out all the stops and let them visualize
what being a part of the team will be like if they choose to join your company.
Answer all their questions. Give them the tour.

If possible, take them out to eat. Take them somewhere unique. Tell
them you�ll be drawing up an offer. And then�pay attention. How do they act at
lunch when they believe the deal is done and they don�t have to �sell you�? Don�t
miss this chance to observe them. How do they treat the wait staff? That�s how
they�ll treat your other employees. When you take them out to eat ask if they�ll
drive. Don�t go somewhere in walking distance. A sales person will have
prepared well for the meeting, but the unexpected, �giving the new boss a ride�


isn�t part of the plan. You�d be surprised what you�ll learn by getting in
someone�s car. Are they organized? Are they clean? Little clues. All are
important.

This is your last chance to change your mind. Next you�ll be making the
ultimate investment. There is one additional item that should be in place for you
to have the best success when hiring and that is the use of scientific
assessments. Let�s look at why these are important.
